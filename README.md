## Apocalypse Cooking


So the pandemic has come and wiped humanity clean off the earth... or kept everyone indoors a few extra hours a day. That's quite something when you consider how much time we already spent indoors!

What can you make to feed yourself in this trying time? The Apocalypse Cooking Guide (tm) is here to help! The ACG (tm) was founded with a simple, noble goal: to enable the last straggling remnants of humanity to survive without sacrificing the opportunity to be insufferable foodies. To create our repository of human cuisine - possibly the last remaining repository of such knowledge left - we first needed to gather recipes. Scraping 19,000 recipes from the New York Times Cooking website before its servers lost power turned out to pose little challenge. Ranking recipes by how appropriate they are for our new post-apocalytic reality turned out to be more difficult.

Originally, the notion had been to rank recipes based on an intuitive logic. Recipes that utilized shelf stable or canned ingredients would be preferred to those requiring fresh, super seasonal or otherwise unique and hard to find ingredients. Similarly, recipes that had few steps, take less time to prepare and which do not require specialist equipment, particularly if said equipment requires electricity, would be preferred. Grills or stovetop cooking should score well, as open fire can even substitute for such methods if cooking gas runs out. High powered blenders or molecular gastronomy techniques would score poorly. A compound rating - our SEnsible Apocalypse Recipe Quotient, or SEAR-Q - utilizing an ingredient score, a preparation score and the average rating from the NYT cooking site could be created in a sabermetrics type fashion.

Simple as this sounds, there's a tricky data-science problem within it - how do you give each of the recipes a score for its ingredients or its preparation? The ACG team is too busy hoarding ammunition and fending off scavengers to personally rate each recipe, so a computer would need be trained to recognize which recipes were more or less appropriate. This task is a prime candidate for machine-learning, because the logic you would need to hard encode would be too complicated. Consider, how to teach the computer which ingredients are shelf stable. Canned beans are, as are dried beans. But you can't simply tell the computer to look for beans, because green beans are not - unless they are of the canned variety, in which case they are.
